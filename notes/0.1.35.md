# SRDF Notes

## New features

This is the first version of the library which is independent from SHACLEX.

## TODO

- Add tests using endpoints. For some reason the test that depends on Fuseki endpoint fails.
- Clean dependencies.
- Add cross compiling to Scala 3 - dotty.
- Implement a scalaJs version.
